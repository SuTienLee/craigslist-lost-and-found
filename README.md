Craigslist’s Lost and Found automatic labeling with python

This python-based project dealt with an issue in Craigslist. By automatically labeling the ads as lost or found within the“lost+found” section, we could ensure posts are accurately labeled and save the users' time. This would improve user and advertising experience. Objective: To provide a search for ads via lost or found and to identify images based on keywords. We scraped data from Craigslist, preprocessed and analyzed data, and built models to automatically label posts into “lost” or “found”.
